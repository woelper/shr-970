# Sig SHR 970 resources
A collection of resources for the SHR 970, a hunting rifle which is not produced any more.

### Purpose
As a SHR 970 owner, maintaining and improving the rifle is challenging. The aim of this page is to collect useful material about the rifle.


### Stock

Generally speaking, the synthetic stock is not nice. It feels cheap, has visible seams from the mould and does not feel very balanced with the end being quite light.

#### MacMillan stock
There are other options, such as wooden stocks and a McMillan stock that was mounted on the STR 970. I've contacted McMillan and a German importer ([Henke](https://henke-online.de)) - while MacMillan said ordering a stock is possible, no distributor seems to be able to get it. Other sources suggest that the moulds were broken down and this stock is no longer available.

#### Wooden stock
