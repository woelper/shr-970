# Sig SHR 970 resources
A collection of resources for the SHR 970, a hunting rifle which is not produced any more.

### Purpose
As a SHR 970 owner, maintaining and improving the rifle is challenging. The aim of this page is to collect useful material about the rifle.


### Stock
Generally speaking, the synthetic stock is not nice. It feels cheap, has visible seams from the mould and does not feel very balanced with the end being quite light. Stock availabilty is quite bad. [Lagardere](https://www.lagardere.ch/) might be the best place to get one.

#### Buttplate
The buttplate is very basic. If you use the magnum calibers, a day at the range will leave you bruised.
I have made measurements of the buttplate. This should help you install a new one.

#### MacMillan stock
There are other options, such as wooden stocks and a McMillan stock that was mounted on the STR 970. I've contacted McMillan and a German importer ([Henke](https://henke-online.de)) - while MacMillan said ordering a stock is possible, no distributor seems to be able to get it. Other sources suggest that the moulds were broken down and this stock is no longer available.

### Optics
In Germany, EAW offers a picatinny rail called
EAW-Montageschiene ( EAW-Nr. 83-00175 ). I have installed it and it works great.

Here are some other parts which may work:
